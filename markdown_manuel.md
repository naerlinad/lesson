# How to work with Markdown

## Text marking

To make your text in italics you suround it by asterisks or underscores like this

    *italics* or _italics_

and you will have it in *italics*.

To make your text bold put 2 asterisks or 2 underscores to both sides of it like this

    **bold** or __bold__

so you will get this **bold**

These 2 syntax alternatives we need to be able to make some part of a emphasised text only in italics and another both bold and in italics, example

    My cat is not shaved, it's a _**sphynx** cat_

so you have

My cat is not shaved, it's a _**sphynx** cat_

## Lists

To make unordered lists put an asterisk (*) or plus (+) before a word or a sentence like this

    * First item
    * Second item
    + Third item

and you will have it like this

* First item
* Second item
+ Third item

To make ordered lists just put a number and a point after it and then go on with an item, example

    1. Item
    2. Item

and you will get this

1. Item
2. Item

## Work with images

To add images, write exlamation mark and after it brackets with a messege you want inbetween, and then path or URL to the image file in parenthesis, example

    ![i wannna live there!](desktop/lesson_2/clocktowers.png)

![i wanna live there!](clocktowers.png)

## Tables

To create tables, use 3 or more hyphens ( --- ) to create a header of a column and use pipes ( | ) to separate each column. Example:

    | Item | Price (per 1 kg) | Quantity | Sum |
    | ---- | ---------------- | -------- | --- |
    | Lemons | 100 RUB | 3 kg 250 g | 100,25 RUB |
    | Cheries | 250,00 RUB | 1 kg 500 g | 375,00 RUB |

The output will be like this:

| Item | Price (per 1 kg) | Quantity | Sum |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------- | --- |
| Lemons | 100,00 RUB | 3 kg 250 g | 100,25 RUB |
| Cheries | 250,00 RUB | 1 kg 500 g | 375,00 RUB |
