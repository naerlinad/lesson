# How to work with Markdown

## Text formating

To make your text in italics, suround it by asterisks ( * ) or underscores ( _ ), like this:

    *italics* or _italics_

And you will have it in *italics*.

To make your text bold put 2 asterisks or 2 underscores to both sides of it, like this:

    **bold** or __bold__

So it becomes **bold**.

These 2 syntax alternatives we need to be able to make some part of an emphasised text only in italics and another part both bold and in italics. Example:

    My cat is not shaved, it's the _**sphynx** cat!_

You'll have this:

My cat is not shaved, it's the _**sphynx** cat!_

## Lists

To make unordered lists put an asterisk ( * ) or plus ( + ) before a word or a sentence, like this:

    * First item
    * Second item
    + Third item

You will have it like this:

* First item
* Second item
+ Third item

To make ordered lists just put a number and a point after it and then go on with a name of an item. Example:

    1. Lemons
    2. Roses

You will get this:

1. Lemons
2. Roses

## Images

To add images, put an exlamation mark and after it brackets with a messege you want inbetween, and then write the path or URL to the image file in parenthesis. Example:

    ![i wannna live there!](desktop/lesson_2/clocktowers.png)

And your image will appear just like this one:

![i wanna live there!](clocktowers.png)

## Links

To create a link in your document, put the link text between brackets [ ] and then right after it put URL in parenthesis ( ), here's the example:

    The [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) is the most used resource to get an overview on something

And here's the output you'll get:

The [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) is the most used resource to get an overview on something

## Tables

To create tables, use 3 or more hyphens ( --- ) to create a header of a column and use pipes ( | ) to separate each column. Example:

    | Item | Price (per 1 kg) | Quantity | Sum |
    | ---- | ---------------- | -------- | --- |
    | Lemons | 100 RUB | 3 kg 250 g | 100,25 RUB |
    | Cheries | 250,00 RUB | 1 kg 500 g | 375,00 RUB |

The output will be like this:

| Item | Price (per 1 kg) | Quantity | Sum |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------- | --- |
| Lemons | 100,00 RUB | 3 kg 250 g | 100,25 RUB |
| Cheries | 250,00 RUB | 1 kg 500 g | 375,00 RUB |

## Quotes

To make blockquotes, put > in front of a paragraph, like this:

    > This is a quote

It will look like this:

> This is a quote

Blockquotes can contain many paragraphs, just put > on blank lines between them:

    > This is quote
    >
    > This is second paragraph

Output:

> This is quote
>
> This is second paragraph

Also quotes can be nested, to make so put >> in front of a paragraph you want to nest:

    > This is quote
    >
    > This is second paragraph
    >
    >> And this is a nested quote

Output:

> This is quote
>
> This is second paragraph
>
>> And this is a nested quote
