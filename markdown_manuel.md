# How to work with Markdown

## Text formating

To make your text in italics, suround it by asterisks ( * ) or underscores ( _ ), like this:

    *italics* or _italics_

And you will have it in *italics*.

To make your text bold put 2 asterisks or 2 underscores to both sides of it, like this:

    **bold** or __bold__

So it becomes **bold**.

These 2 syntax alternatives we need to be able to make some part of an emphasised text only in italics and another part both bold and in italics. Example:

    My cat is not shaved, it's the _**sphynx** cat!_

You'll have this:

My cat is not shaved, it's the _**sphynx** cat!_

## Lists

To make unordered lists put an asterisk ( * ) or plus ( + ) before a word or a sentence, like this:

    * First item
    * Second item
    + Third item

You will have it like this:

* First item
* Second item
+ Third item

To make ordered lists just put a number and a point after it and then go on with a name of an item. Example:

    1. Lemons
    2. Roses

You will get this:

1. Lemons
2. Roses

## Images

To add images, put an exlamation mark and after it brackets with a messege you want inbetween, and then write the path or URL to the image file in parenthesis. Example:

    ![i wannna live there!](desktop/lesson_2/clocktowers.png)

And your image will appear just like this one:

![i wanna live there!](clocktowers.png)

## Links

To create a link in your document, put the link text between brackets [ ] and then right after it put URL in parenthesis ( ), here's the example:

    The [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) is the most used resource to get an overview on something

And here's the output you'll get:

The [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) is the most used resource to get an overview on something
