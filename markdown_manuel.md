# How to work with Markdown

## Text marking

To make your text in italics you suround it by asterisks or underscores like this

    *italics* or _italics_

and you will have it in *italics*.

To make your text bold put 2 asterisks or 2 underscores to both sides of it like this

    **bold** or __bold__

so you will get this **bold**

These 2 syntax alternatives we need to be able to make some part of a emphasised text only in italics and another both bold and in italics, example

    My cat is not shaved, it's a _**sphynx** cat_

so you have

My cat is not shaved, it's a _**sphynx** cat_
