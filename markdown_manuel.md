# How to work with Markdown

## Text marking

To make your text in italics you suround it by asterisks or underscores like this

    *italics* or _italics_

and you will have it in *italics*.

To make your text bold put 2 asterisks or 2 underscores to both sides of it like this

    **bold** or __bold__

so you will get this **bold**

These 2 syntax alternatives we need to be able to make some part of a emphasised text only in italics and another both bold and in italics, example

    My cat is not shaved, it's a _**sphynx** cat_

so you have

My cat is not shaved, it's a _**sphynx** cat_

## Lists

To make unordered lists put an asterisk (*) or plus (+) before a word or a sentence like this

    * First item
    * Second item
    + Third item

and you will have it like this

* First item
* Second item
+ Third item

To make ordered lists just put a number and a point after it and then go on with an item, example

    1. Item
    2. Item

and you will get this

1. Item
2. Item

## Work with images

To add images, write exlamation mark and after it brackets with a messege you want inbetween, and then path or URL to the image file in parenthesis, example

    ![i wannna live there!](desktop/lesson_2/clocktowers.png)

![i wanna live there!](clocktowers.png)

## Links

## Work with tables

## Quotes

To make blockquotes, put > in front of a paragraph, like this:

    > This is a quote

It will look like this:

> This is a quote

Blockquotes can contain many paragraphs, just put > on blank lines between them:

    > This is quote
    >
    > This is second paragraph

Output:

> This is quote
>
> This is second paragraph

Also quotes can be nested, to make so put >> in front of a paragraph you want to nest:

    > This is quote
    >
    > This is second paragraph
    >
    >> And this is a nested quote

Output:

> This is quote
>
> This is second paragraph
>
>> And this is a nested quote
