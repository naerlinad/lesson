# How to work with Markdown

## Text marking

## Lists

To make unordered lists put an asterisk before a word or a sentence like this

    * First item
    * Second item

and you will have it like this

* First item
* Second item

To make ordered lists just put a number and a point after it and then go on with an item, example

    1. Item
    2. Item

and you will get this

1. Item
2. Item
